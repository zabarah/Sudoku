# Sudoku

I had difficulty with why wasnt it checking row
start of the 3*3 box to do the box check took a little bit more time to work on.
tried doing iterative methods and found that it would complicate backtracking. It will also require a hashmap to keep track of combination that didn't work. Found recursion to be a better option using a depth first search method
